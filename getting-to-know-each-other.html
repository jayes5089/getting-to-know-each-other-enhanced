        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>I live in Plainfield and I 
            graduated from Plainfield South High School in 2020 around the time
            when the Covid-19 pandemic began. I currently live with my Mom, Dad and older brother.
            I have an older sister that went to Lewis before, but she resides in Virgina.</p>
        <p>I am majoring in Computer Science and I want to work in cyber security.
            I think its important for everyone to keep themselves safe when using the internet.
            Almost every other day there is a new online threat that tries to get their hands on
            personal data, the data of businesses and companies, and the data from various
            infrastructual organizations that help our world run. The more we can teach people how
            to recognize these threats and how to deal with them if they do become compromised,
            the less likely these attacks will be effective in the future.
        </p>

        <h2>What I hope to learn in this course</h2>
        <p>When I was in my sophmore year in Highschool, I took a programming class
            which pretty much showed me the basics of Python. At that time, I didn't 
            really think I would be able to perform well going into even more 
            advance programming classes, let alone take an interest into programming 
            itself, because I was struggling to meet with project deadlines. Currently, 
            I feel like I've grown from that person I was in highschool. I want to expand my 
            knowledge within this field because I have put it off for far too long.
            I hope that this class will be the first step towards where I want to 
            be in the future, most of the stuff I learned from that highschool class 
            I had forgotten, and I'm hoping to re-learn everything and gain more from this course.
        </p>

        <h2>My Favorite Hobby / Activity</h2>
        <p>Some of my favorite things to do when I'm not working or doing school work 
            is playing video games or watching videos on YouTube. I am currently replaying 
            the campaign for Red Dead Redemption 2 because I really enjoyed the game 
            and how large the world feels in it. For YouTube, I mainly use it as a time-waster. 
            I watch meme compilations on it a lot even when I should be doing productive things.
        </p>

        <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
        <p>I've never been much of an outside person, but I wont turn down the opportunity
            to travel to other states or even outside the country. I've been to 
            atleast 15 states across the US, Canada, Mexico, Switzerland, and Spain. 
            I especially enjoyed my time in Spain, it has a completely different vibe than 
            in the states, and if I have the chance to go back, i'd take it in a heartbeat.</p>

            <h2>Greatest Innovations</h2>
            <p style="color:crimson">Here are some innovations in computer history 
                that I think are the most impressive.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>DeepBlue: A chess computer created around the 1980's by 
                    Feng-hsiung Hsu, a student from Carnegie Mellon University, that 
                    wound up outperforming every artificial and human competitor. 
                    Most notably, the chess grandmaster, Garry Kasparov in 1997.

                <li>Toshiba T1100: A computer widely recognised as the first laptop. 
                    It was produced in 1985, ran entirely off of floppy disks,
                    utilized a 4.77 MHz Intel CPU with 256-512KB of ram, and had an LCD screen. 
                    It was priced at around $1,899.

                </li> 
                <li>Alto Personal Computer: A computer created by Xerox PARC around the 
                    1970's with a rudementory graphical user interface, which likely 
                    influenced the future development of every modern computers graphical 
                    interface.
